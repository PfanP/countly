Before upgrading:

Assuming countly is installed at /var/countly
0) Download new countly version 15.02
1) Rename old countly folder to /var/countly.old
2) Put new countly files in /var/countly
3) Back up your database, for example by making copy of it in ssh:
#assuming your countly database is name countly, execute
mongo
use countly 
db.copyDatabase("countly", "countly_backup")

#to verify there is also a backup dbs execute
show dbs 

(Optionally) you can add plugins by modifying /var/countly/plugins/plugins.json files (adding plugin directory name in the json array)
That will save you node script restart

Upgrading
go to countly directory by typing

cd /var/countly

If you are using countly community edition then type
